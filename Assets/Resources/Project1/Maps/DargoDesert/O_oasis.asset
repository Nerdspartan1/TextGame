    RawText: '<!oasisFound>"Hey ! Check this out !" exclaims Joffre as he points ahead.</!oasisFound>


      </!oasisFound>Amazingly enough, there appears to be a tiny oasis in this location
      : a small pool of clear water surrounded by green verdant vegetation, complete
      with a single tree, creating a much appealing spot of shade.<oasisFound>You
      can rest here if you wish so</oasisFound>


      <!oasisFound>As you approach, you notice a few trails of faded footprints furrowing
      away from this place. It seems like other visitors have come here. Maybe this
      is a known traveller''s resting place ?


      Meanwhile, Joffre is poking at the tree, seemingly to make sure that this is
      not a mirage, even though that is not how mirages work. After making sure that
      this place is indeed real, he turns to you.


      "Well, we can rest here if you want." he declares as he already start to slouch
      against the tree.


      It is true that you could rest here. It would be wise to remember the way to
      this place when you leave, in case you need to return.</!oasisFound>
