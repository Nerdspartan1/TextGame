    RawText: 'You are in front of Dargo City''s massive gate. It is tighly shut down,
      and there is no way that you would be able to force it open from outside.


      Most of the exiles are sitting around in resignation, or mentally preparing
      themselves to part with the only place of civilization they know. You try to
      make out who is able to hold a conversation amongst them.


      Just to the right of the gate sits an old bearded man, looking moodily in the
      distance. Maybe he has some old man''s advices he would be willing to share.


      Standing far away from the gate is a capable-looking caped woman looking cautiously
      in the distance. She looks like she knows a few things about this desert.


      There is a young man still banging furiously at the gate, shouting insults to
      whoever might want to hear them from the other side of the wall.
