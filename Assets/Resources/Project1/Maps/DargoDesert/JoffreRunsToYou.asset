      toward you the young man who was tirelessly banging on the gate of Dargo city
      earlier. He stops in front of you to catch his breath.\n\n\"Hey. I... Can I
      come with you, please ?\" he says while trying to control his respiration.<joffreAcquainted>\"I'm
      sorry for yelling at you earlier, it wasn't against you. I was just so mad about
      being thrown out, but it was really stupid of me to get angry at you.\"</joffreAcquainted>\n\n\nHe
      watches your face, looking for a hint of understanding, but keeps going before
      you can say anything:\n\n\"I realized that just shouting and being mad at nothing
      would lead me nowhere, but you look like you know what you're doing. Then I
      figured that, together, we would stand a better chance at surviving. So please,
      let me help you.\" he says as he bows awkwardly."
