    RawText: "You carefully think of the various conversation topics you could explore
      with Joffre. Eventually, you decide to just ask him why he was exiled, for a
      start. He reacts to the question with a soft sigh: \n\n\"I used to work in a
      gang.\"\n\nHe turns his head to face you, to check if that elicit any reaction
      from you.\n\n\"I was specialized in thievery, you know ? Not the shady stuff
      like kidnapping, or drug dealing.\"\n\nSeeing that you are not judging him,
      he continues:\n\n\"Anyway, today, somehow, I got caught and... that's why I'm
      here.\"\n\nHe looks at his feet for a moment in disappointment.\n\n\"Dammit.\"\n"

      sadly.


      "Yeah, I guess not. But still... this sucks !


      My work was very valued in this gang. Everytime I would perform well, I would
      climb up the ranks, and it felt amazing, you know ? To be good at something,
      and feeling useful and important as a result."


      You raise a very skeptical eyebrow at that last statement, considering the nature
      of the deeds.


      "Come on." he responds with a sly smile. "Theft is not that evil ! I just see
      it as.. redistributing the goods, that''s all."
