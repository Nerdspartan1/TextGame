    RawText: "\"Heeey !\" shouts a voice behind you. \n\nYou turn back and see running
      toward you the young man who was tirelessly banging on the gate of Dargo city
      earlier. He stops in front of you to catch his breath.\n\n\"Hey. I... Can I
      come with you, please ?\" he says while trying to control his respiration.<joffreAcquainted>\"I'm
      sorry for yelling at you earlier, it wasn't against you. I was just so mad about
      being thrown out, and I was really stupid to get angry at you for no reason.\"</joffreAcquainted>\n\nHe
      watches your face, looking for a hint of understanding, but keeps going before
      you can say anything:\n\n\"I realized that just shouting and being mad at nothing
      would lead me nowhere, you know ? But you... you look like you know what you're
      doing... So I figured that... if I came with you, we would stand a better chance
      at surviving, you know ?\"\n\nHe stops for a second, and you not having answered
      in this period of time prompts him to bow awkwardly and plead : \"Please, let
      me come with you.\""
