      got exiled. Bah, doesn''t matter now."


      He looks in the distance to the east.


      "You may have seen a few other exiles head to the east. They hope to reach the
      clan of Jafax, our ex-vassals. But it''s useless, it is too far. No man can
      hope to make the walk there through the desert and the mountains on foot, trust
      me. Your best hope is to head straight south and try to reach the Warrior''s
      forest. There is no civilization there but at least, you will be able to find
      some shade, water and food to survive."


      He pauses to sip on the water bottle that was handed to aged exiles before their
      departure.'
