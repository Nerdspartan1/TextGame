    RawText: 'You sit under the shade of the tree, shielding you from the sun''s blazing
      light, and making the heat a little more bearable. The pool of water next to
      you makes extremely pleasant and peaceful lapping sounds, so rare to the ear
      in this barren land. You close your eyes to focus on the soothing noise. You
      find yourself forgetting all the discomfort that found you on your way here
      as you start to doze off.


      When you wake, you feel appeased and well rested.'

    RawText: A snoring sound remembers you of the presence of Joffre, sleeping soundly
      against the tree. You don't know what to make of him just yet, but you're sure
      that it can't be worse than being alone. It seems like he's going to stick around
      for a while, so maybe you should start getting to know him.
