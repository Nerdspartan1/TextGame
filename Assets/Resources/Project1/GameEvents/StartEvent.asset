    RawText: 'The year is 2119.


      The human civilization on Earth seems to have reached a golden age once again.
      Development and growth are excellent. Technologies are innovating and evolving
      at a boggling speed. Society has successfully suppressed the last remains of
      bigotry and hate among the people for a truly safe and comfortable life for
      all people. Everything is going well and everyone is happy.


      Overhanging this beautiful planet, on the surface of the Moon, lies a small,
      but very comfortable lunar station, called Skybase. This station was a city
      built to house the rich people of Earth, so that they could have a nice and
      quiet home, closer to the stars.


      Dwelling in one of the smaller sized apartments of Skybase is a young man in
      his twenties just waking up from one of those slumber that felt like it was
      too long to be actually revirorating.


      That''s you.'

    RawText: 'You struggle to shift to a sitting position on your bed, and your head
      begins to spins capriciously as you do so. You feel like you slept at least
      one whole day.


      "Ugh, I need to stop doing that." you tell yourself, referring to the oversleeping
      habit that you steadily developped in your time on the Skybase. You wipe your
      sleepy face with a hand, trying vainly to tonify it.


      "Domoe, what time is it ?", you ask sluggishly.


      Domoe is your personal domotic AI assistant, developped by the giant tech company
      Oble. Domoe is a ubiquitous tool that every modern housing possesses; she does
      everything from telling you the time of the day to controlling smartly all household
      appliances. Without her, you would have no idea how to operate your appartment.


      "Domoe ?" you repeat, as no answer is to be heard.'

      shape-memory mattress.


      "Domoe ?" you repeat again as you stumble your way toward the AI''s panel across
      your dark messy room.


      You reach the panel, your sight still blurry, and reboot the system. Finally,
      the room lighens slowly as Domoe wakes from her own slumber.


      "Welcome." she says in a human-like feminine voice.


      It''s quite worrying that you had to reboot her, she usually doesn''t crash
      overnight like this.


      "I am Domoe, your domotic assistant." she continues. "For this first activation,
      please take a few minutes to configure your preference settings."'

      "Skip.", you order.


      "Preference settings are set to default. If you wish to modify them later, you
      can do so from the domotic panel." she states.


      "Domoe, what date is it ?" you ask finally.


      "The date is January the first of year minus two billion, one hundred forty-seven
      million, four hundred eighty-three thousands, six hundreds fourty-eight."


      "Huh-uh." you respond, nonchalant, as you look for your clothes somewhere lying
      on the floor.
