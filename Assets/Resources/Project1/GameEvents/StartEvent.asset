    RawText: 'The year is 2997.


      Human civilization is just phantom of what it once was some thousand years ago.
      Most of the continents have been wiped of all life by years of unending wars,
      famine, and natural disasters of cataclysmic amplitude.


      The population has been drastically decreased. Very few cities managed to adapt,
      let alone survive amidst the chaos and anarchy that ensued.

    RawText: Radical changes had to be made in order to thrive in this new world.
      Society saw a return to a sort of neo-medieval age. Almost all economic and
      technologic growth has been halted. Clans arose to take control of the cities,
      alliances were made and broken. Many clans raised armies to conquer more land
      and expand their territories to salvage what was left of the desolated landscapes
      left by their ancestors.

    RawText: "Built on the remains of what once was Los Angeles, located in what once
      was the United States of America, stood the city of Dargo, held by the clan
      of the same name.\nDargo used to possess the largest population in the remaining
      clans in America and therefore the most numerous army that conquered a large
      chunk of the western coast. \nHowever, due to the extreme climate changes taking
      place during the last hundred years, the outskirts of Dargo City have become
      a vast and infertile desert. This made growing crops ever more difficult, and
      therefore, gave the population less to feed, and Dargo's power steadily faltered
      in the years."

      event to cull the population to reduce it to an acceptable number. Every month,
      inhabitants of the city would be sent into exile to the desert, only to return
      if they had made a useful discovery for the clan. \n\nHowever, volunteer adventurers
      were few, and most of the people sent in the desert would be the least desirable
      and valuable individuals of the clan."
