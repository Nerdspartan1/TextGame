      back in ! You bastards !"


      He bangs furiously on the door several times before he notices you standing
      next to him. He stops to catch his breath, his head resting on his forearm pressed
      against the door and eyes you neglectfully.


      He looks quite young, about the same age as you.


      "What do you want ?" he asks crudely.'

    RawText: 'He suddenly turns to face you and quickly runs a hand into his blond
      hair to clear a stray strand that was hanging over his eyes. You notice that
      he has a quite good looking face with a well defined chin and nose, and blue-gray
      eyes.


      "Hey ! You know what ? You''re right !" he shouts with a sly grin. "I sure would
      like to hear your idea of what to do instead ! Oh what''s that ? Wander off
      into the desert and get killed and maybe eaten by raiders ? No thanks ! I''m
      gonna stick to banging on this door and you can have fun on your own !"


      He then proceeds to immediately resume banging on the gate.


      "Bastaaaaaards ! Open this dooooooooor !"'
