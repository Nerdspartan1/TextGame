You don't even have time to argue that you hear the poundering sound of a chopper approaching. It seems to be landing on top of your building, so you decide to get up there and sort all of this out.

Once on the roof, the chopper greets you.

"Howdy there ! Are you lucky customer n°DR0885678431 ?", it asks gleefully, camera sensors darting at you.

"Err... yes but I think I don't-"

"Amazing !~ Hop in, darling, we've got places to go !"

It's in moments like this you remember your father warned you about the rules of the world "The world", he used to say, "is a very wild place. Everytime you think you get a grip, it always turns out that that grip is something  not very sturdy, like the belief that you are always going to find both of your socks in the drawer. Once it breaks, you slip back into the chaos."

You accept your situation quielty, and decide to board the chopper, not too sure of what's awaiting you.
