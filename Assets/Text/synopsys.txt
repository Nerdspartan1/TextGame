Year 20019:
Humanity has greatly expanded beyond the solar system, now inhabiting thousands of planets and discovering alien species.
Governments are being outpowered by multisystems companies that keep on growing.
The Phalanx, a group formed with the best fighters in the galaxy are put in charge of protecting it by the weak governments 
but face financial difficulties.
The Phalanx made a deal with one of the companies to give them financial support in exchange of offering a place to one of their customers
chosen at random in the galaxy.

The player is chosen amongst billions of customers to be a guest of the phalanx and participate to their missions for a limited period of time

Eventually, the player will become the greatest asset of the Phalanx because of their ability to bring people together.

I- Planet Kaltan:
A broadcast show some crazy scientist that threatens to scramble climates of planets to make living on them impossible.
The phalanx reluctantly brings the player with them

The phalanx goes to the scientist's lab to stop him but gets assaulted by an unknown military force before reaching it.
The player is separated from the rest of the team  and makes his way to the lab on foot while fending off weak monsters.
He encounters Boss in the wreck of the ship on the way there, who is cowering in the pilot's seat, pretending to supervise the 
situation from there

He meets up with Strike, who is fighting against the enemy force. Together they enter the lab but end up in the garbage
compactor. They manage to convince it to stop compacting and get rescued by Sumas

They eventually find the scientist but he escapes, leaving them stranded on the frozen planet.
