It's in moments like this you remember you long ago promised yourself not to go outside too often. Your father used to tell you "The world is like a unresting cup of warm ceylan tea; it's always too hot to enjoy it." The metaphor didn't make any sense but it illustrated impeccably the mental damages of wandering too long out in the world.

"The world is a strange place", used to say your dad "One day you may think you've seen all of it, but it's only better surprise you the next time."
