A few minutes later, you arrive at the spatioport, a very large structure designed to welcome spaceships coming and going to the city. The chopper places itself above a large old-fashioned space vessel, and lowers its altitude until it lands on top of it.

>Chopper : There you go sweetie !~

You get out on the hull. There no one there to welcome you except for the gaping hangar door toward the rear of the ship so you decide to head there. 

The inside is really dark, only dimly lit by the nocturnal light of the city. You progress slowly as your eyes adapt to the obscurity.

Suddenly the hangar door shuts down, making a loud mechanical noise, leaving you in total darkness. You don't have to think too much before spotlights blind you from across the wide room. You protect your eyes with your hands.

>Deep voice : The new recruit has arrived.

It's impossible to make out who is talking to you; the lights are too bright.

>Husky voice : Well it's about damn time ! 

>Husky voice : Why's he look so tiny ?

>Soft voice : Hush, Rachel, we rehearsed this ! Please, don't mess it up!

You hear the one with a deep voice clear his throat. 

>Deep voice : Valiant heart, please come closer...

>Sinister voice : Yeah... "Valiant". Like this guy is totally not here just because he bought a toaster or something.

>Deep voice : Silence soldiers !

You eventually manage to make out four figures standing before you in the dark.

>Deep voice : You are about to become part of the Phalanx, the protectors of the system, that shield your home against the evil.

>Deep voice : We are the guardians of good and civilization, composed of nothing but the best warriors in the galaxy !

>Sinister voice : (whisper) Well, not anymore I guess...

>Deep voice : You have been chosen, recruit. Will you accept your duty ?
