> ??? : Warning. Power malfunction detected.

You start to make out what seems like an infinitely distant beeping sound.

> ??? : Now applying emergency protocol : artificial sleep disengaged.

You feel your senses coming back from utter numbness. Opening your eyes to the flashing light, you find yourself back in your body again. You appear to be lying inside what seems to be a plastic sarcophagus. Before you try to do anything, the lid of your prison emits a loud hissing noise, followed by an equally loud clicking sound, before swinging open.
