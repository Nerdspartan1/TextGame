>Deep voice : Excellent. Truly excellent.

>Deep voice : Recruit, welcome to the team. My name is Boss and I-

>Soft voice : (whisper) Perhaps we should turn on the lights now ?

>Deep voice : Ah- Of course. Sorry.

Light floods the hangar as the spotlights are turned off, giving you full sight of your environment.

>Boss: As I said, my name is Boss and I am the leader of the Phalanx.

Boss is a tall wolf-like creature. His scarred face look like it has seen quite a lot of battles. You don't know how wolf people age but he looks about in his late forties.

>Boss : This is Yau, our medic and intelligence operator.

She.. or he... looks like a slim, pale-skinned, conventionally attractive woman... or man. For now you can't really tell their gender. Despite this oddity, they seem relatively normal, making you wonder what makes them special.

>Yau : Hello ! It's a pleasure to meet you !

>Boss : This is Strike, our tech expert, gun specialist, and recon operator.

Strike is a seemingly young dark elf with dark skin, dark hair and dark pointy ears. His equally dark eyes convey all the animosity he feels toward you.

>Strike : Hm...

>Boss : And lastly, this is Tank, our most efficient warrior, mechanic, and explosive specialist.

Before you stands a very tall and intimidating lizard-women, complete with claws and brown scales. Her face is almost entirely hidden behind a protective medical mask. Her right arm appears to be completely robotic.

>Tank : Sup', chump.

>Boss : Together, we keep the galaxy safe.

>Boss : Alright, now that the presentations are done, let's get you started. Unless you have any question ?

#start4a# Yeah. Why am I here ?

"Oh, is it ? I thought it was because he won a random draw amongst the customer base of Hubris."  says slyly the husky voice.

"Well that's fate, obviously !"
